#### Positional Points
{% include_relative week2/stacked_bar.html %}
* At the QB position, Jeffrey is enjoying a massive advantage over the rest of the league, led by Kyler's sensational 2-game stretch that has vaulted him to 2nd in MVP odds. 
* Varun's solid RB trio of Chubb, Henderson, and Edmonds has given him a considerable edge over the field at the position. 
* The Sitarams' trio of Kupp, McLuaurin, and Thielen is off to an absolutely blazing start, no other set of RBs or WRs is within 30 points of their output. 
* The TE premium strategy is paying dividends for Shivang, the Sitarams, and Anant.
