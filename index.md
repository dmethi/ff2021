## Week 4 Preview
{% include_relative week3/matchups.html %}
* **Madurais vs Sitarams** -- Championship preview, this is primed to be a high scoring matchup between the two early season heavyweights. I'll give a slight edge to the Madurais in this one.
* **Ishan vs Akshay** -- A matchup pitting two teams heading in opposite directions, Akshay will be looking to continue riding the wave of breakout performances on his team while Ishan will be hoping for his star WR duo to finally play up to its potential. I'm calling a breakout week for Ishan this week as he'll hand Akshay his first loss of the season
* **Varun vs Anish** -- After an 0-2 start to the season, both of these teams picked up their first dub last week and will look to contine the momentum and avoid dropping to 1-3. I'm liking Anish's chances a bit better here as Varun's team is battling some major health concerns. 
* **Anant vs Jeffrey** -- Anant will look to break his downward trending performances with a big week here against Jeffrey's predictably injury-riddled team. With 5 players in his starting lineup riding a questionable tag, I'm giving the edge to Anant in this matchup.
* **Methis vs Aman** -- My starting lineup just makes me sad. With the wave of injuries that our team has faced, the goal this week is just to get to 100 points and build some positive mojo going forward. Little to no chance Aman loses this week coming off of his dominant performances the last two weeks. 
* **Shivang vs Kishan** -- A fight between the manager who doesn't check fantasy versus the guy who might as well not check fantasy, I'm still gonna give the edge to Kishan over Shivang who's team is (should be?) in the middle of a major rebuild.

* **Sleeper Rank** -- Your league rank.
* **Power Rank + Power Rank Value** -- Your power ranking, based on a composite of your points scored, your optimal points (as a gauge for overall roster strength), and your 3-week average (to factor in recent form). 
* **Gut Points** -- Your points gained or lost based on making start/sit decisions that go against the optimal lineup suggested by FantasyPros. 
* **Projected Lineup Points** -- The points you would've scored if you started the projected optimal lineup suggested by FantasyPros.
* **Optimal Points** -- The points you would've scored if you started your optimal lineup.
* **Self Inflicted Losses** -- Losses in which a team's projected starting lineup score (best one as suggested by FantasyPros) outscores their opponent's score, but they still lose since their actual starting lineup failed to outscore their opponent's score.
* **Potential Wins** -- Losses in which a team's optimal starting lineup outscores their opponent's score, but their actual starting lineup fails to do so. This stings a bit less since those owners would've had to make a gutsy call in starting a player projected to do worse. Unfortunately both of Varun's losses fall into this category.
