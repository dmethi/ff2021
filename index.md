## Week 6 Preview
{% include_relative week6/matchups.html %}

* **Methis vs Madurais** - 2nd highest scoring projected matchup of the week, this should be an exciting one as both teams are carrying strong momentum heading into this week even though it doesn't carry the highest playoff implications in this one since both of our teams are well positioned to this point. While Akhil's team is at full strength, I'm a little shorthanded coming into this one with Cordarelle and Corey Davis on bye and CMC and Harris both questionable to play with injury concerns. That's why I'm thinking the Madurais are pretty likely to win this one, especially with no signs pointing to any of Zeke, Henry, or Adams slowing down any time soon. 
* **Kishan vs Ishan** - This matchup offers the lowest intrigue in terms of playoff implications with Kishan almost out of it already, and it's probably one of the last chances Kishan will have to spark his team and turn his season around. It's projected to be a close matchup, and all eyes will be on the Kansas City - Washington matchup with 5 players across the two teams playing in that game (Heinecke, Tyreek, Mecole, Gibson, and the Chiefs Defense (yikes....!!)). I'm favoring Ishan in this matchup, but a blowup game by any one of Allen / Hill / Jones / DHop can easily turn the tables and get Kishan his first win of the year. 
* **Aman vs Anish** - The matchup with the highest playoff implications, this is a huge one for both teams - Aman has a chance to get to 2 games over .500, and Anish will need a win to drop to 2 games below .500. Aman is projected as a large favorite here, but things could easily change based on the injury status of both Dalvin Cook and Chris Carson. The key for him will be if Brady and Evans can continue dismantling their opponents - we'll see if they're able to continue their dominance tonight. Anish comes into this matchup having made a big roster change, sending off Rodgers, Godwin, and Damien Williams for Keenan Allen, Teddy, and James Conner. Will this be enough to finally get Anish his first 105 point performance of the year? With Kamara and Mitchell on bye, I'm guessing it won't be - I'm favoring Aman in this one.
* **Shivang vs Anant** - Both teams coming into this matchup off of losses, a win will be huge for both to regain some momentum. This is especially true for Anant who is riding a 4-game losing streak - another loss will drop his playoff odds down to 4% and push him to 4 games below .500. This is nearing do or die time for him, and he comes into this matchup making a much needed roster reshuffle based on his trade with Anish and will hope his new addition Godwin can get his team off to a strong start tonight. Shivang will be looking for another strong week from his receivers to compensate for a depleted RB corps - if CMC plays, Shivang is looking at starting two RBs on the same team. This is projected to be another really tight matchup, but I'm giving Shivang the edge here with all the juicy matchups for his receivers and Kelce.
* **Sitarams vs Varun** - The projected highest scoring matchup of the week, the Sitarams are projected as heavy favorite as they are by far the projected highest scoring team for the week. With both teams at 3-2, this matchup also carries some playoff intrigue as one team will move to 2 games above .500 and one will fall to .500. Varun is coming into this game off of a breakout performance, carrying a 3-game win streak with Lamar, Chubb, Henderson, and Metcalf in spectacular form. The Sitarams are coming off of a tough loss in which they were one start/sit decision away from setting the record for the highest score of the year. I don't think Varun will be able to pull off the upset this week, as I'm thinking the Sitarams will enjoy a comfortable victory en route to handing Varun his first loss since Week 2.
* **Jeffrey vs Akshay** - Jeffrey comes into this matchup beaten down with Saquads, Kittle, and Gronk out with injury and Deebo on bye. This is clearly not the lineup he envisioned rolling with at the start of the season. Akshay is coming off of his first loss of the year despite sensational weeks from Mike Williams, Najee, and Swift, and is clearly eager to get back into the win column. It still surprises me to write this, but Akshay's simply got too much star power in his lineup for Jeffrey to handle this week, and I think Akshay will comfortably pick up his 5th win of the year.

## Season Review
![Week Overview](/week5/week5.png)
* **Sleeper Rank** -- Your league rank.
* **Power Rank + Power Rank Value** -- Your power ranking, based on a composite of your points scored, your optimal points (as a gauge for overall roster strength), and your 3-week average (to factor in recent form). 
* **Gut Points** -- Your points gained or lost based on making start/sit decisions that go against the optimal lineup suggested by FantasyPros. 
* **Projected Lineup Points** -- The points you would've scored if you started the projected optimal lineup suggested by FantasyPros.
* **Optimal Points** -- The points you would've scored if you started your optimal lineup.
* **Self Inflicted Losses** -- Losses in which a team's projected starting lineup score (best one as suggested by FantasyPros) outscores their opponent's score, but they still lose since their actual starting lineup failed to outscore their opponent's score.
* **Potential Wins** -- Losses in which a team's optimal starting lineup outscores their opponent's score, but their actual starting lineup fails to do so. This stings a bit less since those owners would've had to make a gutsy call in starting a player projected to do worse. Unfortunately both of Varun's losses fall into this category.
