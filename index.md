## Week 2 -- Season Stats

### Positional Points Breakdown
{% include_relative week2/stacked_bar.html %}
* At the QB position, Jeffrey is enjoying a massive advantage over the rest of the league, led by Kyler's sensational 2-game stretch that has vaulted him to 2nd in MVP odds. 
* Varun's solid RB trio of Chubb, Henderson, and Edmonds has given him a considerable edge over the field at the position. 
* The Sitarams' trio of Kupp, McLuaurin, and Thielen is off to an absolutely blazing start, no other set of RBs or WRs is within 30 points of their output. 
* The TE premium strategy is paying dividends for Shivang, the Sitarams, and Anant. 

### Projected / Actual / Optimal Points
{% include_relative week2/horitontal_plot.html %}
* **Projected Points** -- points that an owner would've received if they started the optimal lineup based on FantasyPros expert projections. 
* **Actual Points** -- points that an owner has actually scored through 2 weeks. 
* **Optimal Points** -- points that an owner would've scored if they started the perfect lineup possible and left zero points on their bench. 
* Interpretation -- Shivang is horrible at making start / sit decisions (his projected lineup points is way higher than his actual lineup points), while I have made solid start/sit decisions. Somehow, Akshay's lineup has the most upside since he has the highest optimal points in the league.
