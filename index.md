## Week 5 Preview
{% include_relative week5/matchups.html %}
* **Madurais vs Akshay -** Intriguing top of the league matchup. Low leverage matchup for Akshay as his playoff odds currently sit at 95%. A win bumps him to 97% while a loss only drops him to 91%. A bit more on the line for the Madurais whose playoff odds sit at 86% - a win moves them to 92%, while a loss drops them to 77%. I'm giving the edge to the Madurais in this matchup in which their studs should feast in easy matchups.
* **Sitarams vs Ishan -** Lots on the line for Ishan as he needs a win fast to avoid slipping into irrelevance. Playoff odds currently sitting at 20%, a win bumps him to 28% while a loss knocks him down to 13%. Less on the line for the Sitarams with their playoff odds sitting at 87%. A win bumps them to 93% while a loss drops them to 80%. Think the Sitarams should comfortably win this matchup especially with the news of Calvin Ridley sitting this week out.
* **Anish vs Jeffrey -** Big week for Anish with his playoff hopes already down to 15% -- a win will push him to 23% while a loss drops him to 8%. Jeffrey's in a more comfortable spot with his playoff odds at 81%. A win pushes him to 88% while a loss drops him to 70%. Considering Jeffrey's injury woes and question marks at RB2, I'm giving the edge to Anish.
* **Varun vs Anant -** Trying period for Anant as his poor performance till date has caused him to bench most of his starting lineup. Currently with playoff odds sitting at 22%, a win will get him back into it pushing him to 31% while a loss drops him to 12%. Also a big week for Varun - a win will push his playoff odds from 52% to 63% while a loss will drop him to 40%. I'm calling a big bounceback week for Anant here.
* **Methis vs Shivang -** Dead even in the projections, this matchup appears to be a straight toss up. A win will bump my playoff odds from 59% to 70% while a loss drops us to 48%. Given his low scoring, Shivang's playoff odds are currently only 30%, jumping to 41% with a win and dropping to 19% with a loss. I'm gonna be honest, I don't think Shivang stands a chance. 
* **Kishan vs Aman -** Kishan is almost out of it but not quite. With playoff odds down to 7%, a win will only bump him to 11% while a loss will drop him to 3%. For Aman, a win bumps his playoff odds from 49% to 58%, with a loss dropping him to 40%. Especially with Aman starting an inactive running back, I'm thinking Kishan will pick up his first win here.

## Season Review
 ![Week Overview](/week4/week4.png)
* **Sleeper Rank** -- Your league rank.
* **Power Rank + Power Rank Value** -- Your power ranking, based on a composite of your points scored, your optimal points (as a gauge for overall roster strength), and your 3-week average (to factor in recent form). 
* **Gut Points** -- Your points gained or lost based on making start/sit decisions that go against the optimal lineup suggested by FantasyPros. 
* **Projected Lineup Points** -- The points you would've scored if you started the projected optimal lineup suggested by FantasyPros.
* **Optimal Points** -- The points you would've scored if you started your optimal lineup.
* **Self Inflicted Losses** -- Losses in which a team's projected starting lineup score (best one as suggested by FantasyPros) outscores their opponent's score, but they still lose since their actual starting lineup failed to outscore their opponent's score.
* **Potential Wins** -- Losses in which a team's optimal starting lineup outscores their opponent's score, but their actual starting lineup fails to do so. This stings a bit less since those owners would've had to make a gutsy call in starting a player projected to do worse. Unfortunately both of Varun's losses fall into this category.
