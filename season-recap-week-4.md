### 1. Akshay

{% include_relative recap4/ramen005_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/ramen005_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** Akshay's had an amazing start to the season, sitting at 4-0 on the year, emerging victorious in 3 close games to start the season. He currently averages roughly 8 points per game over league average, almost all attributable to his sensational QB play, as Mahomes is averaging 29 points per game. He sits pretty middle of the pack at every other position but has a strong core with Mahomes, Najee Harris, D'Andre Swift, and Mike Williams. 

**Team MVP:** Patrick Mahomes - Even during a time that QBs have become more commoditized and less valued in fantasy, Patrick Mahomes is proving to be one of the most valuable players in Fantasy Football, scoring an insane 8.4 points per game more than the QB12 on the year. Considering the fact that Akshay's margin of victory over the first 3 weeks of the season was less than 8.4 points each week, Mahomes has been a gamechanger for Akshay and is as set and forget as they come.

**Schedule Analysis:**

If he had other teams schedules:

1 | 2 | 3 | 6 | 0  

### 2. Sitarams

{% include_relative recap4/aditya22_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** A true model of consistency, the Sitarams have scored over 120 points every week this year, their only loss coming in a true nailbiter to start the year. Their engine has been their standout WR trio in Kupp, McLaurin, and Thielen, and their team as a whole is scoring over 15 points per game over league average.

**Team MVP:** Cooper Kupp - A massive revelation this season, no one could've foreseen a top-10 season from Kupp coming into the year, let alone having Kupp as the overall WR1 on the year scoring 11 points per game more than the WR30 on the year. Kupp is anchoring a WR corps that is averaging almost 20 points per game more than league average. 

### 3. Madurais

{% include_relative recap4/armadurai_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/armadurai_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** Despite collecting their first loss of the season this past week, the Maduarais sit in a commanding 3-1 position led by their sensational RB duo of Henry and Zeke. The Madurais are scoring just over 11 points per game over league average, and that's pretty much all attributable to their RBs and a strong WR group who are overcoming glaring weaknesses at QB and TE. 

**Team MVP:** Derrick Henry - Proving to be well worth the expensive auction draft price, Henry is the overall RB1 by a wide margin, scoring 20 points more than the RB2 on the season and scoring almost 15 points per game more than the RB30. To put that into perspective, only 7 RBs are scoring more than 15 points per game on the season. Insanity.

### 4. Jeffrey

{% include_relative recap4/ChinkTownBois_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/ChinkTownBois_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** After treading water for the first three weeks, a breakout performance last week has Jeffrey sitting near the top of the league at 3-1. He's scoring roughly 7 points per game over league average, nearly all attributable to Kyler who's amazing start to the season has Jeffrey scoring nearly 7 points per game over league average at the QB position. His WRs are also off to a solid start, with him scoring just over 4 points per game over league average there. It's comical how bad (unlucky?) Jeffrey's been at the kicker position as his weakness there is costing him over 3 points per game relative to league average. Lol.

**Team MVP:** Deebo Samuel - Probably the second biggest surprise on this list, Deebo Samuel has had an unbelievable start to the year scoring almost 20 points per game. Coming into the season, he was written off as the 3rd target (behind Aiyuk and Kittle) on run-heavy offense, boy did that prove to be wrong, and Jeffrey is reaping the benefits as Deebo is scoring almost 9 points per game over WR30 on the year. 

### 5. Methis

{% include_relative recap4/dmethi_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/dmethi_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** Up and down start to the year has me sitting at 2-2, scoring just over 6 points per game over league average. My horrible WR group is costing me almost 9 points per game relative to league average, cancelling out the massive advantage my RBs are providing me. Without elite special teams (kicker and defense), my team would be completely middle of the pack. 

**Team MVP:** Cordarelle Patterson - Hands down the biggest surprise on the year, what began as an innocuous waiver wire pick after Week 1 has turned into one of the biggest breakout seasons in recent history, as the 29-year old journeyman has found a career renaissance in Atlanta and currently sits as the RB3 on the year, adding a spark to a depleted RB corps on my team that has struggled with the losses of Mostert and McCaffrey. He's scoring over 9 points per game more than the RB30 on the year, and I will continue riding this train until the wheels fall off. 

### 6. Varun

{% include_relative recap4/varunagarwal_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/varunagarwal_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** Varun has got to be happy with where he stands up to this point, sitting at 2-2 despite scoring less than league average. His biggest achilles heel has been his WR group, losing 10 points per game relatibe to league average, made up in part by a strong RB group and defense. 

**Team MVP:** D.K. Metcalf - On a team devoid of much talent at WR, Metcalf has offered some much needed stability, averaging 14 points per game. Even though Chubb is RB10 on the year (and Metcalf is WR14), Varun's plentiful RB depth and scarce WR depth has rendered Metcalf much more valuable to his team up to this point. 

### 7. Aman

{% include_relative recap4/YouSmellLikeDaal_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/YouSmellLikeDaal_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** Mediocre would be the way to describe Aman's season to date, as he's within 4 points of league average at every position, showing no elite strenghts or glaring weaknesses and currently scoring roughly 2 points per game less than league average. He's flashed sky high potential with two weeks of over 120 points, but he's also shown a pretty low floor, indicating his team has amongst the highest variance in the league. 

**Team MVP:** Justin Jefferson - Like with Varun, JJ's strong start to the season has been absolutely essential in anchoring a mediocre WR corps. He currently sits at WR7 on the year averaging just over 16 points per game, good for a little over 5 points per game more than the WR30. 

### 8. Shivang

{% include_relative recap4/scboom5_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/scboom5_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** Yikes would be the operative word to use here, as Shivang is currently scoring over 12 points per game less than league average, somehow sitting at 2-2 on the year. This is despite Kelce helping Shivang score 6 points per week over league average at the TE position, as he's getting shafted at the QB, WR, and RB positions. Let's see if he can turn it around. 

**Team MVP:** Travis Kelce - no surprise here, Kelce continues to prove that he's ageless, once again setting the standard at the TE position, averaging just over 15 points per game, almost 7 and a half points per game more than the TE12. He's been one of the few bright spots on a team that's struggling to find its identity 4 weeks into the year. 

### 9. Anant

{% include_relative recap4/anantjindani_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/anantjindani_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** After a 130+ performance after week 1, Anant's been sliding ever since, now falling to 1-3 on the year. While his RB's have been predictably bad to start the year (costing him over 10 points per game relative to league average), the true surprise is the futility of his WR group which was supposed to be his strength but is scoring 4 points per week less than league average. Another surprise - Tucker helping Anant score almost 5 points per game over league average at the K position. That's the 8th biggest positional advantage in the league!

**Team MVP:** T.J Hockenson / Ja'Marr Chase - these two are tied in the value that they bring to Anant's team. While Hockenson has cooled off after a monstrous start to the season, he continues to be a rock solid starter at a scarce TE position. Ja'Marr Chase has been a very pleasant surprise considering the relatively disappointing starts to the season for CeeDee Lamb and Allen Robinson, as Chase currently sits at WR8 on the season scoring just over 15 points per game. 

### 10. Ishan

{% include_relative recap4/ishanchakravarty_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/ishanchakravarty_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** Disappointing start to the year has Ishan sitting at 1-3 scoring more than 6 points per game less than league average. Despite having two of the top 5 drafted WRs on his team, he's scoring over 3 points less than league average at that position, the single biggest shocker for his team to start the year. Despite that, he'd be scoring above average if he had even average QB play, but his league-worst QB group is scoring only 13 points per game, good for almost 8 points per week less than league average at that position. 

**Team MVP:** Austin Ekeler - a flying start to the season for Ekeler has him sitting as the overall RB2, scoring almost 20 points per game. As one of the only three running back's on Ishan's roster (his third RB being Jarret Patterson -- who is he?), Ekeler is essentially priceless for Ishan. 

### 11. Anish

{% include_relative recap4/aaggarwal22_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/aaggarwal22_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** Lot of red on the board for Anish as he's scoring below league average at literally every position besides WR, resulting in him scoring nearly 12 points per game less than league average, resulting in a 1-3 start to the year. The good thing for him I guess is that he's within 4 points of league average at every position, making a positive turnaround a little more likely. 

**Team MVP:** D.J. Moore - a breakout season for D.J Moore has powered him to the overall WR4 on the year scoring over 18 points per game (nearly 8 points per game over the WR30), anchoring a WR corps that filled with questions marks past Moore and Godwin.

### 12. Kishan

{% include_relative recap4/plumsmuggler99_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/plumsmuggler99_stats.html %}

**Season Story:** Despite having a sensational WR group that's scoring nearly 7 points per week over league average, Kishan's awful RB and TE group is costing him heavily resulting in him scoring over 7 points per week less than league average. While he's undeserving of an 0-4 start, he's got a massive hole to climb out of to get back into the season, and step 1 is finding an RB2 to pair with Aaron Jones. 

**Team MVP:** Tyreek Hill - shocking that Kishan is 0-4 despite owning two of the five most valuable players in fantasy up to this point. While Aaron Jones has been unbelievable to start the year, Tyreek Hill scores as the more valuable of the two to Kishan, scoring over 21 points per game powering him to be the overall WR2 on the year, just behind Cooper Kupp. Already with 2 weeks over 30 points, Hill offers week-winning upside that few, if any, in fantasy can reach.
