### 1. Akshay

{% include_relative recap4/ramen005_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/ramen005_stats.html %}

**Team MVP:** Patrick Mahomes - even during a time that QBs have become more commoditized and less valued in fantasy, Patrick Mahomes is proving to be one of the most valuable players in Fantasy Football, scoring an insane 8.4 points per game more than the QB12 on the year. Considering the fact that Akshay's margin of victory over the first 3 weeks of the season was less than 8.4 points each week, Mahomes has been a gamechanger for Akshay and is as set and forget as they come.

### 2. Sitarams

**Team MVP:** Cooper Kupp - a massive revelation this season, no one could've foreseen a top-10 season from Kupp coming into the year, let alone having Kupp as the overall WR1 on the year scoring 11 points per game more than the WR30 on the year. Kupp is anchoring a WR corps that is averaging almost 20 points per game more than league average. 

### 3. Madurais

**Team MVP:** Derrick Henry - proving to be well worth the expensive auction draft price, Henry is the overall RB1 by a wide margin, scoring 20 points more than the RB2 on the season and scoring almost 15 points per game more than the RB30. To put that into perspective, only 7 RBs are scoring more than 15 points per game on the season. Insanity.

### 4. Jeffrey

**Team MVP:** Deebo Samuel - probably the second biggest surprise on this list, Deebo Samuel has had an unbelievable start to the year scoring almost 20 points per game. Coming into the season, he was written off as the 3rd target (behind Aiyuk and Kittle) on run-heavy offense, boy did that prove to be wrong, and Jeffrey is reaping the benefits as Deebo is scoring almost 9 points per game over WR30 on the year. 

### 5. Methis

{% include_relative recap4/dmethi_stats.html %}

**Team MVP:** Cordarelle Patterson - hands down the biggest surprise on the year, what began as an innocuous waiver wire pick after Week 1 has turned into one of the biggest breakout seasons in recent history, as the 29-year old journeyman has found a career renaissance in Atlanta and currently sits as the RB3 on the year, adding a spark to a depleted RB corps on my team that has struggled with the losses of Mostert and McCaffrey. He's scoring over 9 points per game more than the RB30 on the year, and I will continue riding this train until the wheels fall off. 

### 6. Varun

{% include_relative recap4/varunagarwal_stats.html %}

**Team MVP:** D.K. Metcalf - on a team devoid of much talent at WR, Metcalf has offered some much needed stability, averaging 14 points per game. Even though Chubb is RB10 on the year (and Metcalf is WR14), Varun's plentiful RB depth and scarce WR depth has rendered Metcalf much more valuable to his team up to this point. 

### 7. Aman

{% include_relative recap4/YouSmellLikeDaal_stats.html %}

**Team MVP:** Justin Jefferson - like with Varun, JJ's strong start to the season has been absolutely essential in anchoring a mediocre WR corps. He currently sits at WR7 on the year averaging just over 16 points per game, good for a little over 5 points per game more than the WR30. 

### 8. Shivang

{% include_relative recap4/scboom5_stats.html %}

**Team MVP:** Travis Kelce - no surprise here, Kelce continues to prove that he's ageless, once again setting the standard at the TE position, averaging just over 15 points per game, almost 7 and a half points per game more than the TE12. He's been one of the few bright spots on a team that's struggling to find its identity 4 weeks into the year. 

### 9. Anant

{% include_relative recap4/anantjindani_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/anantjindani_stats.html %}

**Team MVP:** T.J Hockenson / Ja'Marr Chase - these two are tied in the value that they bring to Anant's team. While Hockenson has cooled off after a monstrous start to the season, he continues to be a rock solid starter at a scarce TE position. Ja'Marr Chase has been a very pleasant surprise considering the relatively disappointing starts to the season for CeeDee Lamb and Allen Robinson, as Chase currently sits at WR8 on the season scoring just over 15 points per game. 

### 10. Ishan

{% include_relative recap4/ishanchakravarty_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/ishanchakravarty_stats.html %}

**Team MVP:** Austin Ekeler - a flying start to the season for Ekeler has him sitting as the overall RB2, scoring almost 20 points per game. As one of the only three running back's on Ishan's roster (his third RB being Jarret Patterson -- who is he?), Ekeler is essentially priceless for Ishan. 

### 11. Anish

{% include_relative recap4/aaggarwal22_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/aaggarwal22_stats.html %}

**Team MVP:** D.J. Moore - a breakout season for D.J Moore has powered him to the overall WR4 on the year scoring over 18 points per game (nearly 8 points per game over the WR30), anchoring a WR corps that filled with questions marks past Moore and Godwin.

### 12. Kishan

{% include_relative recap4/plumsmuggler99_record.html %}
{% include_relative recap4/plumsmuggler99_stats.html %}

**Team MVP:** Tyreek Hill - shocking that Kishan is 0-4 despite owning two of the five most valuable players in fantasy up to this point. While Aaron Jones has been unbelievable to start the year, Tyreek Hill scores as the more valuable of the two to Kishan, scoring over 21 points per game powering him to be the overall WR2 on the year, just behind Cooper Kupp. Already with 2 weeks over 30 points, Hill offers week-winning upside that few, if any, in fantasy can reach.
